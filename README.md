# ConsoleGPT

## Summary
A console application chatbot written in C# using an unofficial Open AI API: https://github.com/OkGoDoIt/OpenAI-API-dotnet

## Project Goals
Learning to interact with external API calls, async Tasks, File.IO, and learning more about AI models.

## Instructions
Before being able to run this program, you must have an Open AI account, and create a valid API key.
This can be done here: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

When running the application, you must enter a API key to start if one cannot be found.
This will be stored locally on your computer as a .openai file, and read when the program is started.

Once chat has started, you can ask questions and talk to your new console assistant.
